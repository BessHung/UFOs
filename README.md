### Summary

- One of drawbacks is that the filters section is designed as a texbox for users to input. That is to say, users have to know what the values are in each column and have to input the value exactly the same with the table.
- With some adjustments, for example, allowing user to input the value in the textbox like "tri*" to search the shape value which is start with "tri". Furthermore, it can use a drop-down list or a checkbox for filters instead. It can not only avoid user to input the wrong value, but also allow users to filter mutiple values in one column by using checkbox, for example users can select the shape "circle" and "triangle" at the same time.
